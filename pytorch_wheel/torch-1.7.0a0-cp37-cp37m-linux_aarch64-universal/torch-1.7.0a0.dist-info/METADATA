PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features:
- Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration
- Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system

You can reuse your favorite Python packages such as NumPy, SciPy, and Cython to extend PyTorch when needed.

## More About PyTorch

At a granular level, PyTorch is a library that consists of the following components:

| Component | Description |
| ---- | --- |
| [**torch**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html) | a Tensor library like NumPy, with strong GPU support |
| [**torch.autograd**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html) | a tape-based automatic differentiation library that supports all differentiable Tensor operations in torch |
| [**torch.jit**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html) | a compilation stack (TorchScript) to create serializable and optimizable models from PyTorch code  |
| [**torch.nn**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html) | a neural networks library deeply integrated with autograd designed for maximum flexibility |
| [**torch.multiprocessing**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/multiprocessing.html) | Python multiprocessing, but with magical memory sharing of torch Tensors across processes. Useful for data loading and Hogwild training |
| [**torch.utils**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html) | DataLoader and other utility functions for convenience |

Usually, PyTorch is used either as:

- a replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs.
- a deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed.

Elaborating further:

### A GPU-Ready Tensor Library

If you use NumPy, then you have used Tensors (a.k.a. ndarray).

![Tensor illustration](./docs/source/_static/img/tensor_illustration.png)

PyTorch provides Tensors that can live either on the CPU or the GPU and accelerates the
computation by a huge amount.

We provide a wide variety of tensor routines to accelerate and fit your scientific computation needs
such as slicing, indexing, math operations, linear algebra, reductions.
And they are fast!

### Dynamic Neural Networks: Tape-Based Autograd

PyTorch has a unique way of building neural networks: using and replaying a tape recorder.

Most frameworks such as TensorFlow, Theano, Caffe, and CNTK have a static view of the world.
One has to build a neural network and reuse the same structure again and again.
Changing the way the network behaves means that one has to start from scratch.

With PyTorch, we use a technique called reverse-mode auto-differentiation, which allows you to
change the way your network behaves arbitrarily with zero lag or overhead. Our inspiration comes
from several research papers on this topic, as well as current and past work such as
[torch-autograd](https://github.com/twitter/torch-autograd),
[autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd),
[Chainer](https://chainer.org), etc.

While this technique is not unique to PyTorch, it's one of the fastest implementations of it to date.
You get the best of speed and flexibility for your crazy research.

### Python First

PyTorch is not a Python binding into a monolithic C++ framework.
It is built to be deeply integrated into Python.
You can use it naturally like you would use [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/) / [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) / [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) etc.
You can write your new neural network layers in Python itself, using your favorite libraries
and use packages such as [Cython](https://cython.org/) and [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/).
Our goal is to not reinvent the wheel where appropriate.

### Imperative Experiences

PyTorch is designed to be intuitive, linear in thought, and easy to use.
When you execute a line of code, it gets executed. There isn't an asynchronous view of the world.
When you drop into a debugger or receive error messages and stack traces, understanding them is straightforward.
The stack trace points to exactly where your code was defined.
We hope you never spend hours debugging your code because of bad stack traces or asynchronous and opaque execution engines.

### Fast and Lean

PyTorch has minimal framework overhead. We integrate acceleration libraries
such as [Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/mkl) and NVIDIA ([cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn), [NCCL](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl)) to maximize speed.
At the core, its CPU and GPU Tensor and neural network backends
(TH, THC, THNN, THCUNN) are mature and have been tested for years.

Hence, PyTorch is quite fast – whether you run small or large neural networks.

The memory usage in PyTorch is extremely efficient compared to Torch or some of the alternatives.
We've written custom memory allocators for the GPU to make sure that
your deep learning models are maximally memory efficient.
This enables you to train bigger deep learning models than before.

### Extensions Without Pain

Writing new neural network modules, or interfacing with PyTorch's Tensor API was designed to be straightforward
and with minimal abstractions.

You can write new neural network layers in Python using the torch API
[or your favorite NumPy-based libraries such as SciPy](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/numpy_extensions_tutorial.html).

If you want to write your layers in C/C++, we provide a convenient extension API that is efficient and with minimal boilerplate.
No wrapper code needs to be written. You can see [a tutorial here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_extension.html) and [an example here](https://github.com/pytorch/extension-cpp).


## Installation

### Binaries
Commands to install from binaries via Conda or pip wheels are on our website:
[https://pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org)


#### NVIDIA Jetson Platforms

Python wheels for NVIDIA's Jetson Nano, Jetson TX2, and Jetson AGX Xavier are available via the following URLs:

- Stable binaries:
  - Python 3.6: https://nvidia.box.com/v/torch-stable-cp36-jetson-jp42
- Rolling weekly binaries:
  - Python 3.6: https://nvidia.box.com/v/torch-weekly-cp36-jetson-jp42

They require JetPack 4.2 and above, and [@dusty-nv](https://github.com/dusty-nv) maintains them


### From Source

If you are installing from source, you will need Python 3.6 or later and a C++14 compiler. Also, we highly recommend installing an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) environment.
You will get a high-quality BLAS library (MKL) and you get controlled dependency versions regardless of your Linux distro.

Once you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) installed, here are the instructions.

If you want to compile with CUDA support, install
- [NVIDIA CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) 9.2 or above
- [NVIDIA cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) v7 or above
- [Compiler](https://gist.github.com/ax3l/9489132) compatible with CUDA

If you want to disable CUDA support, export environment variable `USE_CUDA=0`.
Other potentially useful environment variables may be found in `setup.py`.

If you are building for NVIDIA's Jetson platforms (Jetson Nano, TX1, TX2, AGX Xavier), Instructions to install PyTorch for Jetson Nano are [available here](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1049071/jetson-nano/pytorch-for-jetson-nano/)

#### Install PyTorch
On Linux
```bash
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX:-"$(dirname $(which conda))/../"}
python setup.py install
```

On macOS
```bash
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX:-"$(dirname $(which conda))/../"}
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9 CC=clang CXX=clang++ python setup.py install
```

Each CUDA version only supports one particular XCode version. The following combinations have been reported to work with PyTorch.

| CUDA version | XCode version |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| 10.0         | XCode 9.4     |
| 10.1         | XCode 10.1    |


On Windows

At least Visual Studio 2017 version 15.6 with the toolset 14.13 and [NVTX](https://docs.nvidia.com/gameworks/content/gameworkslibrary/nvtx/nvidia_tools_extension_library_nvtx.htm) are needed.

If the version of Visual Studio 2017 is higher than 15.6, installing of "VC++ 2017 version 15.6 v14.13 toolset" is strongly recommended.
<br/> If the version of Visual Studio 2017 is lesser than 15.6, please update Visual Studio 2017 to the latest version along with installing "VC++ 2017 version 15.6 v14.13 toolset".
<br/> There is no guarantee of the correct building with VC++ 2017 toolsets, others than version 15.6 v14.13.
<br/> "VC++ 2017 version 15.6 v14.13 toolset" might be installed onto already installed Visual Studio 2017 by running its installation once again and checking the corresponding checkbox under "Individual components"/"Compilers, build tools, and runtimes".

NVTX is a part of CUDA distributive, where it is called "Nsight Compute". To install it onto already installed CUDA run CUDA installation once again and check the corresponding checkbox.
Be sure that CUDA with Nsight Compute is installed after Visual Studio 2017.

Currently, VS 2017, VS 2019, and Ninja are supported as the generator of CMake. If `ninja.exe` is detected in `PATH`, then Ninja will be used as the default generator, otherwise, it will use VS 2017.
<br/> If Ninja is selected as the generator, the latest MSVC which is newer than VS 2015 (14.0) will get selected as the underlying toolchain. If you use CMake <= 3.14.2 and has VS 2019 installed, then even if you specify VS 2017 as the generator, VS 2019 will get selected as the generator.

CUDA and MSVC have strong version dependencies, so even if you use VS 2017 / 2019, you will get build errors like `nvcc fatal : Host compiler targets unsupported OS`. For this kind of problem, please install the corresponding VS toolchain in the table below, and then you can either specify the toolset during activation (recommended) or set `CUDAHOSTCXX` to override the Cuda host compiler (not recommended if there are big version differences).

| CUDA version | Newest supported VS version                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 9.2          | Visual Studio 2017 Update 5 (15.5) (`_MSC_VER` <= 1912) |
| 10.0         | Visual Studio 2017 (15.X) (`_MSC_VER` < 1920)           |
| 10.1         | Visual Studio 2019 (16.X) (`_MSC_VER` < 1930)           |

```cmd
cmd

:: [Optional] If you want to build with VS 2019 generator, please change the value in the next line to `Visual Studio 16 2019`.
:: Note: This value is useless if Ninja is detected. However, you can force that by using `set USE_NINJA=OFF`.
set CMAKE_GENERATOR=Visual Studio 15 2017

:: Read the content in the previous section carefully before you proceed.
:: [Optional] If you want to override the underlying toolset used by Ninja and Visual Studio with CUDA, please run the following script block.
:: "Visual Studio 2017 Developer Command Prompt" will be run automatically.
:: Make sure you have CMake >= 3.12 before you do this when you use the Visual Studio generator.
set CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET_VERSION=14.11
set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1
for /f "usebackq tokens=*" %i in (`"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vswhere.exe" -version [15^,16^) -products * -latest -property installationPath`) do call "%i\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64 -vcvars_ver=%CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET_VERSION%

:: [Optional] If you want to override the Cuda host compiler
set CUDAHOSTCXX=C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.11.25503\bin\HostX64\x64\cl.exe

python setup.py install

```

##### Adjust Build Options (Optional)

You can adjust the configuration of cmake variables optionally (without building first), by doing
the following. For example, adjusting the pre-detected directories for CuDNN or BLAS can be done
with such a step.

On Linux
```bash
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX:-"$(dirname $(which conda))/../"}
python setup.py build --cmake-only
ccmake build  # or cmake-gui build
```

On macOS
```bash
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX:-"$(dirname $(which conda))/../"}
MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9 CC=clang CXX=clang++ python setup.py build --cmake-only
ccmake build  # or cmake-gui build
```

### Docker Image

#### Using pre-built images

You can also pull a pre-built docker image from Docker Hub and run with docker v19.03+

```bash
docker run --gpus all --rm -ti --ipc=host pytorch/pytorch:latest
```

Please note that PyTorch uses shared memory to share data between processes, so if torch multiprocessing is used (e.g.
for multithreaded data loaders) the default shared memory segment size that container runs with is not enough, and you
should increase shared memory size either with `--ipc=host` or `--shm-size` command line options to `nvidia-docker run`.

#### Building the image yourself

**NOTE:** Must be built with a docker version > 18.06

The `Dockerfile` is supplied to build images with Cuda support and cuDNN v7.
You can pass `PYTHON_VERSION=x.y` make variable to specify which Python version is to be used by Miniconda, or leave it
unset to use the default.
```bash
make -f docker.Makefile
# images are tagged as docker.io/${your_docker_username}/pytorch
```

### Building the Documentation

To build documentation in various formats, you will need [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) and the
readthedocs theme.

```bash
cd docs/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You can then build the documentation by running ``make <format>`` from the
``docs/`` folder. Run ``make`` to get a list of all available output formats.

If you get a katex error run ```npm install katex```.  If it persists, try
```npm install -g katex```
